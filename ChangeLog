*setools-4.0.1 (17 May 2016)

  Library:
  * Fixed a compile error on 32bit systems.
  * Changed domain transition analysis output to use lists instead
    of generators.  This fixes a display problem in apol's DTA browser.

  Apol:
  * Replaced icons with stock Qt icons to remove license issues
    with some distributions.

  Sesearch:
  * Changed xperm options to bring in line with sediff, e.g. --allowx
    changed to --allowxperm.  Python's argument parser will still detect
    --allowx as an abbreviation of --allowxperm, so compatibility is preserved.


*setools-4.0.0 (04 May 2016)

  First 4.0 release.  SETools is reimplemented in Python.
